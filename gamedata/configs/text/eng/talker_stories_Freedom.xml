    </string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_52">
        <text>You used to make money as a self-employed taxi driver in your previous life. After having to sell your cab to pay the divorce lawyers you had no way to keep working, so you came to the Zone. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_60">
        <text>You have spent years in the Zone, but still can't get used to the violence and death. Firefights stress you out and taking lives never gets easier, even when it's done in self-defence. Sometimes you see the faces of the people you've killed in your nightmares. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_61">
        <text>You have discovered several mutated fungi species in the Zone that have psychedelic properties. You are worryingly frequently high on tea brewed on these fungi, although if confronted you would never admit that you are addicted. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_62">
        <text>You are addicted to morphine. It started as a medical necessity after sustaining a minor combat injury in the Zone, but it quickly became your only comfort to deal with the mental stress of life in the Zone. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_63">
        <text>When you were still fairly fresh in the Zone you foolhardily tried to venture into the Red Forest.

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_64">
        <text>You're an accomplished nature photographer who came to the Zone to take pictures of all the unique flora and fauna. Your lifelong ambition has been winning a 'Wildlife Photographer of the Year' award, and you hope your work in the Zone will seal it for you. </text>

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_66">

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_68">

	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_69">
        <text>You don't really care one way or the other about Freedom's ideals. You joined because they had a safe HQ in the Army Warehouses and seemed a more chill and laid-back bunch than Duty. </text>
	</string>
		<string id="talker_stories_Freedom_70">
        <text>Your best friend and fellow member of Freedom was killed during an assault on Rostok before the war between Freedom and Duty was de-escalated. You have a particularly strong hatred of Duty compared to most Freedom members. </text>
